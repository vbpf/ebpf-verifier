## About

This project aims to create an Apache-licensed library for executing eBPF programs. The primary implementation of eBPF lives in the Linux kernel, but due to its GPL license it can't be used in many projects.

[Linux documentation for the eBPF instruction set](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/filter.txt)

[Instruction set reference](https://github.com/iovisor/bpf-docs/blob/master/eBPF.md)

This project includes an eBPF assembler, disassembler, interpreter,
and JIT compiler for x86-64.

## Building

Run `make -C vm` to build the VM. This produces a static library `libubpf.a`
and a simple executable used by the testsuite.

## Compiling C to eBPF

You'll need [Clang 3.7](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.7.0).

    clang-3.7 -O2 -target bpf -c prog.c -o prog.o

You can then pass the contents of `prog.o` to `ubpf_load_elf`, or to the stdin of
the `vm/test` binary.

## Contributing

Please fork the project on GitHub and open a pull request. You can run all the
tests with `nosetests`.
